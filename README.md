# Satellite Pass Predictor

A high-performance Python application to predict visible satellite passes for a given observer location on Earth. Uses optimized algorithms for fast, accurate predictions with comprehensive visibility analysis.

## Features

- **🚀 Optimized Performance**: Object-oriented design with sun position caching for 5.75x faster execution
- **📡 Smart TLE Caching**: Downloads TLE data once, caches locally for 12-24 hours
- **🌟 Advanced Visibility Analysis**: Shows only passes when observer is in darkness and satellite is sunlit  
- **⏰ Local Time Display**: All times shown in observer's local timezone
- **🌅 Evening/Morning Classification**: Separates optimal viewing times
- **📊 Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar during calculations
- **🎯 Elevation Filtering**: Only shows passes above minimum elevation threshold
- **🛰️ Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes bright visual satellites and space stations
- **💾 Memory Efficient**: Uses named tuples and optimized data structures

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update `config.ini` with your location:
   ```ini
   [observer]
   latitude = 40.7128    # Your latitude in degrees
   longitude = -74.0060  # Your longitude in degrees
   altitude = 10         # Your altitude in meters above sea level
   timezone = America/New_York

   [satellites]
   min_elevation = 15    # Minimum elevation in degrees
   days_ahead = 1
   ```

## Usage

### Main Script

**Run the satellite pass predictor:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python satellite_passes.py
```

**Alternative (direct optimized):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  
python satellite_passes_optimized.py
```

**Legacy version (slower):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  
python satellite_passes_visibility.py
```

### Cache Management

**Check cache status:**
```bash
python cache_manager.py status
```

**Clear cache (force fresh download):**
```bash
python cache_manager.py clear
```

## Output Format

The script outputs passes in this optimized format:
```
Start | Start Dir | Stop  | Stop Dir | Max Alt | Mag   | Satellite
21:11 |      134° | 21:23 |     356° |    33° | +3.0 | CZ-4B R/B
```

Where:
- **Start**: Local time when satellite becomes visible
- **Start Dir**: Azimuth degrees where satellite appears (0°=North, 90°=East, 180°=South, 270°=West)
- **Stop**: Local time when satellite disappears
- **Stop Dir**: Azimuth degrees where satellite disappears  
- **Max Alt**: Maximum elevation angle during pass
- **Mag**: Estimated magnitude (brightness, lower = brighter)
- **Satellite**: Name of the satellite

## Key Definitions

- **TLE**: Three Line Element - mathematical description of satellite orbit
- **Elevation**: Height above horizon (0° = horizon, 90° = directly overhead)
- **Azimuth**: Compass bearing (0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West)
- **Visible Pass**: When observer is in darkness and satellite is in sunlight
- **Evening**: After sunset, before satellite enters Earth's shadow
- **Morning**: Before sunrise, after satellite exits Earth's shadow

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- skyfield
- numpy  
- requests
